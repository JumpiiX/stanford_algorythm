# Stanford Algorithm QuickSort Problem

This repository contains a solution to the Stanford Algorithm problem using the QuickSort algorithm. The goal is to compute the total number of comparisons used to sort a given input array by QuickSort. The first element of the array is always chosen as the pivot.

## Files

- `main.py`: Contains the implementation of the QuickSort algorithm and the logic to count comparisons.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python quicksort.py
